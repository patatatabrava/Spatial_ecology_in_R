# My first markdown document

This language is useful for writing reports, for example.

<!-- the 3 symbols at the start mean we're going to write code (as opposed to text). The "r" means we're writing the code in R. "eval = TRUE" gives the output of the code in this section, instead of just showing the expressions. -->
<!-- the comments must be written outside the code. -->

```{r, eval = TRUE} 
2 + 3 
``` 
<!-- these 3 symbols also go at the end of your code -->

You can also choose not to make the calculations:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
2 + 3 
```
<!-- if a function in your code doesn't give an output, it doesn't matter whether you write "eval = TRUE" or "eval = FALSE". Btw, you can also just write "eval = T" or "eval = F" -->

```{r, eval = TRUE} 
library(imageRy)
```
