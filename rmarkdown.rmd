# My first markdown document

texty text

<!-- the 3 symbols at the start mean we're going to write code (as opposed to text). The "r" means we're writing the code in R. "eval = TRUE" gives the output of functions/operations, instead of leaving the expressions as is.-->
<!-- the comments must be written outside the code. -->

```{r, eval = TRUE} 
2 + 3 
``` 
<!-- these 3 symbols also go at the end of your code -->

You can also choose not to make the calculations:

```{r, eval = FALSE} 
2 + 3 
```
